    <h1>1. Markup languages</h1>
    <p>
    A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. 
    Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.<br><br>

    <strong>Types of markup languages</strong><br><br>
        
         - Presentational markup - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. <em>Microsoft Word</em>).<br>
         - Procedural markup - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. <em>TeX</em>).<br>
         - Descriptive (logical) markup - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. <em>HTML</em>). <br>
        </p>

    <h2>1.1. HTML</h2>  
        <p>
            <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br><br>
            HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.
        </p>

    <h3>1.1.1. How the browser displays HTML</h3>
        <ol>
         <li>The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
         <li>The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
         <li>A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
         <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>1. Markup languages</h1>
            <p>
            A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.

            <h2>Types of markup languages</h2>
                <p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>- <strong>Presentational markup</strong></dt><dd> - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word).</dd> <br>
                        <dt>- <strong>Procedural markup</strong></dt><dd> - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX).</dd> <br>
                        <dt>- <strong>Descriptive (logical) markup</strong></dt><dd> - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML).</dd>

                <p>
                    HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br><br>
                    HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.
                </p>
                <h3>1.2.1. How the browser displays HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree.</li>
                            <li>The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree.</li>
                            <li>A layout is generated from the render tree.</li>
                            <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout.</li>
                        </ol>
